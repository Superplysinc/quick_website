<div><h1>Cello</h1>
  <p>Cello was my first love. Orâ€¦ maybe it was just a way for me to stay away from the piano or violin? Anyways, one of my core memories was my mother
    listening to the 1st Suite of the Bach Prelude when we were in the kitchen together. I asked my mother what that massive instrument was.
    It looked so powerful to me. So striking. So beautiful. Although she said no at first, my months of begging made her finally buy me my first cello. Even up until now, my passion for the instrument remains the same as what it was years ago when I first heard it.
    From practicing multiple hours a day on the instrument to many different countries with my orchestra (Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra) each of these experiences I will cherish dear to my heart.
    Although coming to PA may have diminished my childhood dreams of becoming a professional classical cellist,
    I hope to play the instrument my entire life for my own physical and spiritual well being.</p>
