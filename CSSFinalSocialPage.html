<div><h1>Social Life</h1><p>Attending a school like Phillips Academy is very stressful and rigorous. All throughout my Andover career, I have been told by numerous people that Andover is a place you cannot possibly go through by just yourself. Especially with it being upper year, I cannot agree with it more. Luckily, I have a great group of friends at my side that have been at my side and are there whenever I am in need of support or just a good time in the common room after a long day of school and extracurriculars such as swimming and cello. After Andover, the best memories are not the things that I had learned in the classrooms but rather the small things such as hanging out in the great lawn, or a goofy 3 AM late night Tetris gaming session.</p><img class = "PicFriends" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1yoIGN6qSVFXwV8PEogaupdQqbMJ1wspZ"/><p>Picture: Upper Gala with friends on my birthday</p><a href="CSSFinalSchoolPage.html">School&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a><a href = "CSSFinalSwimmingPage.html">Swimming&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a><a href="CSSFinalCelloPage.html">Cello&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a></div>
