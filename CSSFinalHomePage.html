<div><h1>Greetings, Internet Traveler!</h1>
<p>My name is Andrew Kim, and welcome! I am currently an 11th grader (Upper) here at Phillips Academy Andover and I am so happy for you being able to take some precious time out of  your day to visit me.
 It's been some time ever since my last visitor!</p>
 <p>Feel free to roam around! I have links attached below that each lead to parts of my life that I think would help you get to know me better.</p>
