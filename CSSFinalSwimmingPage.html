<div><h1>Swimming</h1><p> Having swam my entire life, I am extremely passionate about the sport of swimming. It is quite ironic given that I had almost drowned my swim instructor as a baby due to my fear of putting my face in the water. Now, I have developed to be quite the swimmer having won an individual New England title for my age group, and being a core member of the well established Andover Boys Swimming Varsity team. My favorite events are the 100 yd Butterfly, 200 yd Butterfly, 200 yd Freestyle, and 100 yd Freestyle. I am currently looking at athletic recruitment, and hope to eventually swim at the NCAA Division 1 Championships</p><img class = "PicButterfly" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-F_bEHVWwueryRNtQn3Ea-6b7nsrb79X"/><div><p>Picture: NEPSAC Division 1 Championships at Phillips Exeter Academy; 100yd Butterfly Final<p><a href="CSSFinalSchoolPage.html">School&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a><a href="CSSFinalCelloPage.html">Cello&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a><a class href="CSSFinalSocialPage.html">Social Life&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</a></div>
